# Vampire_Killer
A project to recreate the videogame Vampire Killer.
Vampire Killer is a platform RPG video game from the saga Castlevania, and the only one of the saga which was created for the console MSX2. It was released in Japan in 1986

This game has a labyrinth-style structure, which makes the player seek out for hidden objects or doors. We have to combine our combat skills with our skills to jump from platform to platform.

The main goal of the game is to defeat Dracula and bring peace again to Transylvania. To achieve this, we must explore Draculaâ€™s castle, passing through different stages. Each level features a hidden key which opens a room where we will have to defeat a boss. As we progress, the difficulty of the game gets harder. We play as Simon Belmont, a vampire-hunter, who is armed with his powerful whip, the Vampire Killer.
